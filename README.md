# Time_series_project

** Overview
Due to the climate of India, it is prone to many kinds of natural disaster at different times of
the year. For this the Government of India has allocated two types of funds -State Disaster
Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). In this project we are
mostly interested in SDRF. For SDRF, the contribution is made by both the Central
Government and State Governments for all states. The SDRF shall be used only for meeting
the expenditure for providing immediate relief to the victims of cyclone, drought,
earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloud burst, pest attack
and frost & cold wave. Initially we do an exploratory analysis to find the insight of the
data,association and pattern.
Next, we try to see any particular factors like population, area and coastline length of the
states are affecting the allocation of SDRF. So we only focus on the 9 states with coastline
areas (West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu , Kerala, Karnataka, Goa,
Gujrat and Odisha). We also check the assumptions of our model and if any assumption is
violated(i.e if the data has heteroscedasticity or multicollinearity or autocorrelation) we will
take measures to remove any model inadequacies.
Lastly we would like to do a time series analysis on the data mainly to forecast the 2024
SDRF for the 28 states. Our entire analysis will be focused within the period 2011-2023 and
will check how close the forecasted SDRF values are for year 2024(the 2024 data has
released recently). We also want to do a bivariate time series to incorporate any possible
correlation between states and central to get better results
